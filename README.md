# ApriltagExperiment
In this repository, we want to share our experiment with apriltag. And also, we answer the questions of what is apriltag, how we use it, which component do we use and why. 
You can reach our steps from Documeents folder. And, under Code folder, test and project codes can be found. 
* Step 0 --> What is AprilTag?
* Step 1 --> Needed Componnets for our Project
* Step 2 --> AprilTag Usag with Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Step 3 --> Basic Car with Raspberry Pi Zero
* Step 4 --> Giving Basic Command to Car with AprilTag

## Introdction
We start the our project with searching what is AprilTag, how did AprilTag originate and envolve, what is the science behind it. AprilTag is a visual fiducial system, useful for a wide variety of tasks including augmented reality, robotics, and camera calibration. Targets can be created from an ordinary printer, and the AprilTag detection software computes the precise 3D position, orientation, and identity of the tags relative to the camera. The AprilTag library is implemented in C with no external dependencies. It is designed to be easily included in other applications, as well as be portable to embedded devices. Real-time performance can be achieved even on cell-phone grade processors.
