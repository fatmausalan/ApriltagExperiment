AprilTag Detection

What is AprilTag?
	AprilTag is a visual fiducial system, useful for a wide variety of tasks including augmented reality, robotics, and camera calibration. 
Targets can be created from an ordinary printer, and the AprilTag detection software computes the precise 3D position, orientation, and identity of the tags relative to the camera. 
The AprilTag library is implemented in C with no external dependencies. It is designed to be easily included in other applications, as well as be portable to embedded devices. 
Real-time performance can be achieved even on cell-phone grade processors.

What will we do in this experiment?
	We are aiming to detect AprilTag with a camera and directing a car according to the tag's family.
Thanks to this, we will be able to solve some location detection problems. For example, forklifts
can detect any material's location in a hangar.

Which technologies will we use?
	RaspberryPi Zero, Python, OpenCV and AprilTag libraries.
